# NexP: A Beginner Friendly Toolkit for Designing and Conducting Controlled Experiments
This repository is the running platform of web-based [NexP](http://www.nexp.site/) (NEXt EXPeriment) toolkit.

## Brief introducton
In this project, we introduce NexP (Next Experiment Toolkit), an open-source toolkit for designing and running controlled experiments. In NexP, we implement a common platform for running different types of controlled experiments leveraging the browser. NexP can automatically read the experimental JSON file and output the whole web-based framework in the arranged order for running the experiment. Experienced programmers can modify the source code of this web framework according to their needs and implement tasks as they require.  
  
The design platform generates a script file that can be executed in the running platform. The measured data (e.g., pre-defined dependent variables) collected by the running platform are saved as CSV files, which can be further analyzed elsewhere.  

Please refer to the NexP [publication](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67687-6_10) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDMMeLdiKic) if you are interested. We are also very honored to hold a course at CHI 2016 to teach audiences on how to design HCI controlled experiments. Check more details on the course [here](https://chi2016course.wordpress.com/).
